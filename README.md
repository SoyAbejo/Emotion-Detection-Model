# Emotion Detection Model

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI model capable of detecting the underlying emotion in a user-provided text prompt. The model will classify the text into predefined emotional categories, such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc. Building AI course project.

## Background

Emotional detection in text is a crucial aspect of natural language processing (NLP) with applications in customer service, mental health analysis, social media monitoring, and more. Detecting emotions can help understand user sentiment and improve interactions between humans and machines.

* Understanding customer emotions can improve service in call centers.
* Identifying emotional distress in social media posts can trigger mental health support.
* Enhancing user experience in AI-driven applications by making them more empathetic.

My motivation for this project stems from the growing importance of emotional intelligence in technology. As AI systems become more integrated into daily life, ensuring they can understand and respond to human emotions is vital.

## How is it used?

The model can be integrated into various platforms:

* **Customer service:** Automated systems can use the model to gauge customer sentiment and adjust responses accordingly.
* **Mental health apps:** Detecting signs of emotional distress in user inputs can trigger supportive measures.
* **Social media monitoring:** Brands can analyze public sentiment about their products or services.

Users will input text prompts into the system, which will then analyze the text and return the detected emotion. This can be used in real-time applications where understanding user sentiment is critical.


## Data sources and AI methods

The project will utilize a publicly available dataset containing text labeled with emotions:

* [Emotion Dataset from Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/dair-ai/emotion) - This dataset includes text data with corresponding emotion labels. **Licensing Information:** The dataset should be used for educational and research purposes only.

The model will leverage NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, specifically the Naive Bayes classifier, due to its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification tasks.

* **Text preprocessing:** Tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
* **Feature extraction:** Using techniques like TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.
* **Modeling:** Training a Naive Bayes classifier to predict emotions based on text input.

## Challenges

* **Data quality:** Ensuring the dataset used is diverse and representative of different contexts.
* **Ambiguity in text:** Some emotions can be subtle or mixed, making them hard to classify correctly.
* **Ethical considerations:** Ensuring the system is used responsibly, especially in sensitive areas like mental health.

## What next?

To enhance the project:

* **Model improvement:** Incorporate more sophisticated models and larger datasets for better accuracy.
* **Deployment:** Develop APIs or integrate the model into existing platforms.
* **User feedback:** Gather feedback from real users to continually refine the system.

Skills and assistance needed:

* Collaboration with NLP experts to refine the model.
* Input from domain experts in customer service and mental health.
* Development support for creating user-friendly interfaces and APIs.
